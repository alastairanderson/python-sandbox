Regression: predict fuel efficiency

In a regression problem, we aim to predict the output of a continuous value, like a price or a probability. 
Contrast this with a classification problem, where we aim to select a class from a list of classes (for 
example, where a picture contains an apple or an orange, recognizing which fruit is in the picture).

This example uses the classic Auto MPG Dataset and builds a model to predict the fuel efficiency of 
late-1970s and early 1980s automobiles. To do this, we'll provide the model with a description of 
many automobiles from that time period. This description includes attributes like: 
cylinders, displacement, horsepower, and weight.

Also look at the overall statistics:
'''
train_stats = train_dataset.describe()
train_stats.pop("MPG")
train_stats = train_stats.transpose()
print(train_stats)

'''
Split features from labels
https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/basic_regression#split_features_from_labels

Separate the target value, or "label", from the features. This label is the value that you will 
train the model to predict.
'''
train_labels = train_dataset.pop('MPG')
test_labels = test_dataset.pop('MPG')

'''
Normalize the data
https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/basic_regression#normalize_the_data

Look again at the train_stats block above and note how different the ranges of each feature are.

It is good practice to normalize features that use different scales and ranges. Although the model 
might converge without feature normalization, it makes training more difficult, and it makes the 
resulting model dependent on the choice of units used in the input. 

Note: Although we intentionally generate these statistics from only the training dataset, these 
statistics will also be used to normalize the test dataset. We need to do that to project the test 
dataset into the same distribution that the model has been trained on.

This normalized data is what we will use to train the model.
'''
def norm(x):
    return (x - train_stats['mean']) / train_stats['std']

normed_train_data = norm(train_dataset)
normed_test_data = norm(test_dataset)

'''
Caution: The statistics used to normalize the inputs here (mean and standard deviation) need to be 
applied to any other data that is fed to the model, along with the one-hot encoding that we did 
earlier. That includes the test set as well as live data when the model is used in production.

Conclusions
https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/basic_regression#conclusion

This example introduced a few techniques to handle a regression problem.

    - Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a common loss function used for regression problems (different loss 
      functions are used for classification problems).

    - Similarly, evaluation metrics used for regression differ from classification. A common regression 
      metric is Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

    - When numeric input data features have values with different ranges, each feature should be scaled 
      independently to the same range.

    - If there is not much training data, one technique is to prefer a small network with few hidden 
      layers to avoid overfitting.
    
    - Early stopping is a useful technique to prevent overfitting.
