    What is a boosted tree?

    This tutorial is an end-to-end walkthrough of training a Gradient Boosting model using decision trees with 
    the tf.estimator API. Boosted Trees models are among the most popular and effective machine learning approaches 
    for both regression and classification. It is an ensemble technique that combines the predictions from several 
    (think 10s, 100s or even 1000s) tree models.

    Boosted Trees models are popular with many machine learning practioners as they can achieve impressive performance 
    with minimal hyperparameter tuning.
